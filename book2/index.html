                <p>This chronicle records the establishment of the first Hebrew kingdom in the western lands, the fulfillment of ancient prophecies, and the beginning of that great movement which would see the throne of David planted in the uttermost parts of the earth.</p>
                
                <p>Here is told how divine providence guided the wandering children of Zerah to their appointed destiny, and how the breach spoken by the midwife in ancient days found its healing in the marriage of bloodlines beneath foreign stars.</p>
                
                <p>From the marble halls of the Milesian court to the ancient groves of ancient Iberia, witness the forging of a warrior-king through exile and trial. See how Gathelus of the Red Hand, prince without a kingdom, becomes the founder of a dynasty that will endure through ages.</p>
                
                <p>This is no mere tale of conquest and settlement, but the record of covenant faithfulness across generations, the testimony of how the Most High God accomplishes His purposes through the faith and courage of those who trust in His promises.</p>

                    <strong>Kerman Gild</strong> brings together extensive research in ancient history, biblical archaeology, and Celtic traditions to craft this epic chronicle.

                    <em>The Red Hand & The Eternal Throne</em> represents years of careful study into the migration patterns of the lost tribes of Israel, the establishment of early Celtic kingdoms, and the intersection of Hebrew and Celtic cultures in the western lands. The chronicle maintains historical authenticity while exploring the spiritual dimensions of covenant faithfulness across generations.
