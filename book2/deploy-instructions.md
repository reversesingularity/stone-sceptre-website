## Performance Optimization

### Image Optimization

1. Compress images using tools like:
   - [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/)
   - [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/)
   - [Squoosh](https://squoosh.app/)

2. Use appropriate formats:
   - JPEG for photos
   - PNG for graphics with transparency
   - WebP for modern browsers (with fallbacks)

### CSS and JavaScript Optimization

1. Minify files using tools like:
   - [CSS Minifier](https://cssminifier.com/)
   - [JavaScript Minifier](https://javascript-minifier.com/)

2. Combine files to reduce HTTP requests

### Content Delivery Network (CDN)

Consider using a CDN for faster global delivery:
- Cloudflare (free tier available)
- AWS CloudFront
- Google Cloud CDN

## Security Considerations

### HTTPS Setup

1. Always enable HTTPS/SSL
2. Use tools like [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) for free certificates
3. Configure HTTP to HTTPS redirects

### Security Headers

Add security headers via hosting configuration:
```
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
```

## Monitoring and Analytics

### Google Analytics

1. Create Google Analytics account
2. Add tracking code to `index.html` before closing `</head>` tag:

```html
<!-- Google Analytics -->
<script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=GA_TRACKING_ID"></script>
<script>
  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
  function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
  gtag('js', new Date());
  gtag('config', 'GA_TRACKING_ID');
</script>
```

### Search Console

1. Verify your site with Google Search Console
2. Submit sitemap (create `sitemap.xml` if needed)
3. Monitor search performance

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Site Not Loading

1. Check DNS propagation (can take 24-48 hours)
2. Verify all files uploaded correctly
3. Check hosting account status
4. Review error logs if available

### HTTPS Certificate Issues

1. Wait for certificate provisioning (can take several hours)
2. Verify domain ownership
3. Check DNS configuration
4. Contact hosting support if issues persist

### Performance Issues

1. Test with tools like:
   - [Google PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/)
   - [GTmetrix](https://gtmetrix.com/)
   - [WebPageTest](https://www.webpagetest.org/)

2. Common fixes:
   - Optimize images
   - Enable gzip compression
   - Use browser caching
   - Minimize HTTP requests

## Maintenance

### Regular Updates

1. Keep content fresh and current
2. Update book information as needed
3. Monitor for broken links
4. Review analytics regularly

### Backup Strategy
