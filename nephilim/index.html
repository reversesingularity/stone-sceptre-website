                <p>He has hunted monsters for 2,600 years. He thought he knew what was coming.</p>

                <p>He was wrong.</p>

                <p>In 586 BCE, Celtic warrior Cian mac Morna received a sword, a commission, and a secret
                that would only be revealed when the world was ready for it. Twenty-six centuries later —
                having survived the Fall of Jerusalem, the Black Plague, and every war in between —
                the sword finally speaks.</p>

                <p>The Two Witnesses of Revelation are returning. Cian is their Guardian. And the ancient
                enemy has spent five thousand years preparing for exactly this moment.</p>

                <p>Deep in the Cydonian plains of Mars, orbital imagery has revealed something that should
                not exist: a sigil carved before the Flood. The mark of an oath sworn by two hundred fallen
                angels before they destroyed the ancient world and were imprisoned in chains of darkness.
                An oath that was never meant to be found.</p>

                <p>But Naamah found it first.</p>

                <p>She has many names across many centuries. The Watchers called her their queen. Scripture
                calls her the Whore of Babylon. And she has spent five millennia building the infrastructure
                for their release — corrupting bloodlines, cultivating power, and waiting with inhuman
                patience for the one thing she still needs: the key to the Abyss.</p>

                <p>Now a private Mars mission is racing toward Cydonia. The sword Cian carries is made from
                the same ancient ore as the chamber on that red plain. And somewhere in Eden, the prophet
                Elijah has been waiting — sustained by the Tree of Life — for the hour of his return.</p>

                <p>The chains are weakening. The oaths are stirring. And Cian mac Morna — 2,631 years old,
                deeply scarred, and constitutionally incapable of following orders he disagrees with —
                must prepare for a war that scripture promised was coming but no one believed would arrive
                in their lifetime.</p>

                <p>It has arrived.</p>

                <p class="synopsis-tagline"><em>THE CYDONIAN OATHS is the first volume in The Nephilim Chronicles —
                a five-book biblical apocalyptic thriller drawing on 1 Enoch, the Book of Jubilees, and the
                prophecies of Revelation. For readers of Frank Peretti, Joel C. Rosenberg, and anyone who
                ever wondered what really happened before the Flood.</em></p>

                    Methuselah's Sword — Mo Chrá — whose teal-gold luminescence marks him as set
                    apart. Hunter of abominations, deeply scarred but unshakably faithful. He is
                    constitutionally incapable of following orders he disagrees with — a limitation

                    in empyreal register: thee, thou, elevated vocabulary, cosmic gravitas.
                    Subject to The Ban: cannot intervene against mortal humans, only supernatural
                    threats. Has been arguing with Cian for twenty-six centuries. Both find it

                    of running have produced a woman fluent in Krav Maga, tradecraft, and
                    reading money trails like maps. She carries her mother's files — evidence
                    capable of destroying an empire — and a darker inheritance she cannot see:
                    an ancient demonic claim that follows her, ensuring every person who tries

                    inexplicable weapons collection. He was spectacularly wrong. A direct
                    descendant of Niamh — Cian's sister — Brennan carries a bloodline that
                    has been hunted for 2,500 years and a gift for engineering that built

                    without making a fuss about it, loving her with the quiet, non-performative
                    dedication of a man who understands that showing up is the whole job.
                    Now he is responsible for turning a team of brilliant aerospace engineers
                    into people who can survive contested environments. He views this as
                    a solvable problem. He is slightly wrong about that, and he knows it.</p>

                    <p class="character-role">The Eleven</p>
                    <p>Eleven aerospace engineers — flight dynamics, software architecture,
                    materials science, communications, robotics, cybersecurity, acoustic
                    engineering — who built the most improbable Mars mission in history
                    from a converted warehouse in Austin, Texas. They were not recruited
                    to fight a war. They were recruited to build things that work in
                    impossible conditions. It turns out the distinction matters less
                    than anyone hoped.</p>

                    <p class="character-role">The Living Weapon</p>
                    <p>"My Heart" in ancient tongue. The sword that sustains Cian's life and
                    ages him at a rate of one year per century. Its teal-gold luminescence
                    marks it as operating on the Acoustic Paradigm — the technology of sound
                    that mirrors how God spoke creation into existence. When drawn, it
                    resonates at a frequency that Nephilim cannot endure. It considers Cian
                    the finest monster-slayer since Methuselah, and will never tell him so.</p>

                    <p class="character-role">The Fallen Commander</p>
                    <p>Captain and supreme commander of the two hundred Watchers who abandoned
                    their celestial post on the Cydonian plains of Mars and descended to
                    Mount Hermon. His obsession with a Cainite woman named Naamah is what
                    triggered the entire catastrophe. Imprisoned in the Abyss since the
                    Flood judgment, bound by chains of darkness until the Day of Judgment —
                    but the oaths his council swore were never annulled. And oaths have

                    resolving of enchantments. It was Armaros who stepped forward on the
                    Cydonian plain and declared: "Let us all swear an oath together and
                    bind ourselves by mutual imprecations upon it." When Armaros constructed
                    a vow, it was legally perfect. Eternally binding. Without escape clause
                    or provision for repentance. His sigil — carved before the Flood — is
                    what Brennan's rovers photographed on the Martian plain.</p>

                    <p>One of Shemyaza's twenty chiefs of tens. He taught humanity the
                    first weapons of death — not out of malice, but out of a cold certainty
                    that violence is the truest expression of power. He deceived Eve into
                    sanctioning weapons for her own children's protection. The cascade of
                    that teaching — armouries, armies, the industrialisation of violence —
                    runs unbroken from antiquity to the present day. He is imprisoned.

                    genuine power before the first night was over. She has survived the
                    Flood, the collapse of every empire she ever built, and five thousand
                    years of hunter networks trying to find her. She has many names across
                    many centuries, and many faces across many cultures. What she has never
                    had is a reason to hurry. She is patient in a way that makes geological

                    <p>Turned in ancient Sumer. Approximately five thousand years old.
                    In 586 BCE he was contracted to imprison Mo Chrá and was promised a
                    virgin sacrifice to power the wards. Cian recovered the sword and took
                    his sister home, and the debt was never paid. Vârcolac is not motivated
                    by hatred — he is motivated by accounting. The interest on 2,500 years
                    of unpaid debt has compounded to a figure he calculates can only be
                    settled by eliminating the entire bloodline. He has murdered 247
                    confirmed members of Niamh's family. He also killed Miriam Ashford's
                    mother. It wasn't personal. Just business.</p>

                <p><strong>Kerman Gild</strong> brings together extensive research in
                biblical prophecy, ancient Jewish apocalyptic literature, and Celtic
                history to craft The Nephilim Chronicles. Drawing from primary sources
                including the Book of 1 Enoch, the Book of Jubilees, the Dead Sea Scrolls,
                and detailed biblical chronology, the author weaves together theological
                precision and narrative compulsion.</p>

                <p><em>The Cydonian Oaths</em> represents years of careful study into
                the Watcher mythology of Second Temple Judaism, the theology of the Two
                Witnesses of Revelation 11, and the implications of Genesis 6 for
                eschatological warfare. The Acoustic Paradigm — the series' central
                theological-technological framework — emerged from studying the Hebrew
                understanding that God spoke creation into existence through sound.</p>

                <p>Kerman Gild is also the author of The Stone and the Sceptre Chronicles,
                a companion series tracing the covenant promises from 586 BCE through
                the establishment of Celtic kingdoms in the western lands.</p>
